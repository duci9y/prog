#### Problem 6
###### CodeChef Code: `D1`
## Product of Divisors

Being in love with number theory, Johnny decided to take a number theory course. On the first day, he was challenged by his teacher with the following problem: given a number **N**, compute the product of its positive divisors. Johnny is desperate to impress his new teacher so he asks you for help.

In this problem, the divisors of **N** do not include the number **N** itself. For example, if **N**=12, the divisors of **N** (excluding **N**) are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Thus, the product of divisors is 1x2x3x4x6=144. Since the result may be very large, if the result has more than 4 decimal digits, Johnny only needs to compute the **last 4 digits** of it.

#### Input

The first line contains **T**, the number of test cases. Then, **T** test cases follow.

Each test case contains a single integer **N** (1 ≤ **N** ≤ 500,000) whose product of divisors needs to be computed.

#### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the corresponding result of that test case.

#### Example

**Input:**

    6
    3
    4
    12
    25
    957
    10000

**Output:**

    1
    2
    144
    5
    7493
    0000
