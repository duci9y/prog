#### Problem 4
###### CodeChef Code: `IITK1P11`
## Adding Two Numbers

Devu is a little boy. He does not know how to take carries while adding two numbers in decimal base. eg. He will struggle in adding numbers 83 and 19, because
3 + 9 = 12 and he needs to take a carry of 1.

You are given an integer **n**. Can you write it in terms of sum of two positive integers such that while adding them in base 10, Devu doesn't need to use any carries?

#### Input

First line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line containing an integer **n**.

#### Output

For each test case, print a single line `YES` or `NO` according to situation in the problem.

#### Example

**Input:**

    2
    1
    9

**Output:**

    NO
    YES

**Explanation:**

1 can not be written in the desired way.

9 can be written as sum of 2 and 7. Devu doesn't need to use any carries here.
